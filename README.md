# About 
 
- We are a Developer Student's Club and for the next three months, we'll be collectively learning Python. This is the course we're following: https://programming-24.mooc.fi/

- This week we're going to learn Git and GitHub. 

# How To Submit Your Task

1. Clone the repository using your PAT.
2. Create a folder inside the root repository:
    - Name your folder using the first letters of your name, followed by an underscore then followed by random three numbers. For example, if your name is John Done, name your folder as 'jd_524'
    - Create a README file inside your folder - that describes how you approached your solution.

3. Push the changes, and submit a pull request for review.
4. You're done - you've submitted your task.
